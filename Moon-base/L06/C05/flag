The flag is: 7z0Bf8NEi5tm9XzBwkmm

Question:
Ok, the excellent team on the next level have identified another alien server on a second alien probe ship that's headed to the moon, but it's protected in a more sophisticated way than the other. We need you to write a Python script which downloads a key, reverses it and then sends it back. Note that the key changes based on a timer.

Instructions:

Send server ("localhost", 10000) GET_KEY to retrieve the key.
Reverse the key and send it back.
Tip: Successfully send back the key in time to get the flag.


Walkthrough: 
#
import socket
clientsocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client.connect(('localhost', 10000))
client.send('GET_KEY'.encode())
data = client.recv(1024)
data2 = (data[::-1])
client.send(data2)
data3 = client.recv(1024)
print(data3)
