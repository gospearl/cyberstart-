The flag is: Hoi06bQoCygJNYd5syvJ

Question: Agent, thanks to your efforts in finding the gang member leading the effort to send a robot to the bank, we've managed to recover some C code we think might be used by the robot to take photos, but we can't be sure because running it currently returns a segmentation fault. Another agent has rigged up the code to a camera interface. See if you can fix the code, get it to run and take a photo.

Tip: Take the photo, the robots confirmation message will show the flag.

Code: 
int main()
{
  int take_photo = 0;
  char command[8];
  char *pictures = "take_pictures";
  strcpy(command, pictures);

  if (strcmp(command, "take_pictures") == 0) {
    printf("%s\n", "CLICK_PHOTO_TAKEN");
    take_photo = 1;
  } else {
    printf("%s\n", "SEG_FAULT_NO_PHOTO");
  }
  return 0;
}



Walkthrough: This is a segmentation fault. i.e, you're trying to access a restricted
area of memory. To fix this, change the command[8] to a higher number that can allocate more space to the picture address. 




int main()
{
  int take_photo = 0;
  char command[14];
  char *pictures = "take_pictures";
  strcpy(command, pictures);

  if (strcmp(command, "take_pictures") == 0) {
    printf("%s\n", "CLICK_PHOTO_TAKEN");
    take_photo = 1;
  } else {
    printf("%s\n", "SEG_FAULT_NO_PHOTO");
  }
  return 0;
}
