The flag is: HadouKEN[^_^]

Question:
Agent, we've just received a bunch of files from one of our field agents taken from one of the senior gang members hard drives, and our team is having trouble putting it all together. Maybe you can help?

Here's what we have: a decryption program which takes a string as an argument, but when we run it we just get junk back; some encrypted text, and; a weird image file of a calendar. A bizarre combination, take a look and see if you can figure it out.

Tip: Run the correct string through the decryption program to get the flag.




Walkthrough:  - download files
- open image file showing calendar, note date
- change computer date to calendar date
- open terminal and run exe file downloaded by ‘./filename NXIS24@ul{}mzVKV’
- the flag will come up but remember to change your time back on your computer before submitting the flag to cyberstart
