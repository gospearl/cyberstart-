the flag: AYGtKy5Nbc5RukjAxkB


Walkthrough
This is a buffer overflow question.

step 1: i gave execution permission to the file
step 2: I ran the program and i was prompted for the password
step 3: I randomly inputted a very long alphanumeric string and i was given the flag

Method 2: This is a more sophisticated method
python -c 'print "A"*100' | ./program-x86

this creates a string of 100 'A' characters and inputs it into the program when it is run
