The flag is :  jCAkCT8eqdBSaZ3nHpw7


Question: In what we thought was an unrelated piece of intel, one of our field agents monitoring the gang reported this morning that he noticed one of them looking at a site which sells pencils. Well, it seems they're using it for something else too - to hide files.

Luckily for us, we think the site is vulnerable to command injection. See if you can use the comment form to get access and find a file, we think it has a list of the gang members involved in the planned robbery and their particular role in the attack, so it's vital we get our hands on it right away.

Tip: Find the file, it contains the flag.


Walkthrough: $(cat ../flag.txt)
