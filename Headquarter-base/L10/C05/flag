The flag is: 4XAEhDJvZBuine9CCzmzcYmR

Question:
Log into this SSH server using the details below. We've received word that the gang has been using this public server to pass messages through the use of man pages. We need to see if they've used a particular code word (matryoshka) which they're using to say when to start implementing their plan. See if you can find it.

Walkthrough:
We have to search all the manpages for the word "matryoshka" but we don't know the exact man page 

Method 1:
we can use this command 
man -K "matryoshka"

which will then take us inside the man page that contains the word. the flag can be seen in the description.

Method 2:
Using the apropos command which searches for a keyword in names and descriptions of man pages.

apropos "matryoshka"

This outputs the name of the man page where the word can be found. You can the go to that particular manpage using the man command.
