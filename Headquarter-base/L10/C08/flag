The flag is: zftNrRCk3Yx8xBsAFpJ

Question:
Hmm, this is an interesting one for you, recruit. We have a file that the Spetzners have been sending back and forth between them for a while. We have no idea what it is or how to get access. We've tried running it and answering the question it asks but to no avail.

Why don't you give it a try and see if you can get access.

Tip: Get access to the file to get the flag.



Walkthrough: - Download file
- go the download location and add .exe to the extension 
- return to your terminal to run the file using ./file name.exe (you might have to grant permission first by running chmod +xâ€¦)
- the number to make it negative is +2147483647
- the flag will come up
