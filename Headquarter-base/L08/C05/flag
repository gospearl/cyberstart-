Question: Quick extra project for you, recruit.

We have managed to gain access to a server, which is running The Chiquitoo gang's secure encryption service. We need the password they are using as the encryption key. Can you find out what it is for me?

SSH sessions only last 60 minutes, after that you will need to reload the page to get a new one.
Tip: The flag is the password


Walkthrough:  
ssh into the server then use the command
ps aux | grep -i "flag"
to get the flag
