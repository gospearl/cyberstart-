The flag is: TkxZxVxCtPUL7SHxt7a

Question: Hmm, these Chiquitoos are clever. We've intercepted a program that takes a password in and generates some output. We found the correct password (it's "password") but it still won't let us in. The other agents are stumped. Can you take a look and see if you can figure out how to get the output?

Tip: Get it right and you get the flag.


Walkthrough: After downloading the file, add execution permission to it 
then echo "password" | ./program-x86
