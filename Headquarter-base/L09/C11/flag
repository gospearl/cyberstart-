The flag is B3znJluppFPJnNG7PAg


walkthrough

I downloaded the files then 
i used file to determine what type of image it was
but it gave me no hint

then i used binwalk to get more info and one of the jpgs had a zip file embedded in it

I unzipped the file using unzip and it worked

the extracted file(msg) had executable permission so i used ./msg to run it 
after a couple of seconds, i got the flag
